I programmed this graphing calculator as a beginner Javascript project with the help of the p5.js library. 
I'm pretty happy that I was able to reason through a way to build function graphing using basic Javascript 
knowledge on for loops, arrays, eventListeners, and more. However, the code is pretty messy, and it's 
function is limited by its dependency on Javascript's eval() function. For future adjustments, I'll probably
use the Math.js library in place of eval() and implement zooming and panning (when I figure it out).
